Version 1.32 - MILESTONE RELEASE!!!

-This version is the first archive to witness the site-wide implementation of the renaming of OSHistory and its subsites with the suffix "History" to SysPedia and the suffix to "Pedia" due to the pre-existing OSHistory website on the internet (the URL is oshistory.org, maybe oshistory.com).

-I have noticed many errors while looking through the website. However, they will not be fixed until active development of MacPedia (formerly macHistory and yes, the M is supposed to be uncapitalised in the old name as evident from the logo_mH.png file available in the MacPedia folder which is inaccessible to you at the time of writing) ceases and the interim period between this event and the commencement of active development of the next subsite - that may be UbuntuPedia or AndroidPedia - starts.

-The past few releases have been Milestone releases as each update brings about a major change due to allotment of time and resources to the development of MacPedia rather than WinPedia.

-It is guaranteed that regular maintenance and fixing of bugs and information will continue for a brief period before the commencement of the next subsite.

The logo_mH.png file is no longer available as I am trying to erase all residue of the -History suffix branding.
